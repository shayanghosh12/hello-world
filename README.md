# hello-world
My first repository, and general dumping and experimenting ground

I am a PhD candidate at the Indian Institute of Science, working on High Energy Physics. Since my field of work is so very removed from direct real world applications, I have decided to work on some project in my free time so as to develop some real life skills that will help me in case I do not, or am uunable to, continue in academia. My learning how to use github is a step in that process.
